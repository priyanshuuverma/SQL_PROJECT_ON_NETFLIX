# SQL_PROJECT_ON_NETFLIX
 Data Analysis on 8808 Rows in PostgreSQL (pgAdmin 4) This project involves performing data analysis on a dataset containing 8808 rows using PostgreSQL in the pgAdmin 4 environment. The dataset could represent various types of information, such as sales data, customer records, inventory management, or any domain-specific dataset.

# Overview
______________________________________________________________________________
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions.

# Objectives
________________________________________________________________________________
1. Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
2. Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
3. List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
4. Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.
# Tools & Technologies:
1. PostgreSQL: The database management system used for querying and managing the dataset.
2. pgAdmin 4: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for connecting to PostgreSQL, creating and executing SQL queries, and managing the database schema.
3. SQL: Structured Query Language used to perform all data manipulation and retrieval tasks.

# Project Steps:
1. Dataset Upload & Schema Design: Loading the 8808 rows dataset into PostgreSQL and creating tables with appropriate column types.
2. Data Preprocessing: Using SQL commands to clean and prepare the data for analysis, ensuring no invalid or redundant records exist.
3. Data Analysis: Writing SQL queries to perform aggregations, filtering, and sorting to uncover valuable insights (such as average sales, customer demographics, etc.).
4. Performance Tuning: Indexing key columns and optimizing SQL queries for better performance.
5. Reporting: Generating reports and visualizations (if applicable) based on the insights derived from the dataset.
